🌟 Project & Learning Portfolio Summary

I actively enhance my technical skills by learning new tools and building small, practical projects that give me hands-on experience. Each project is focused on:

🔹 Solving real-world problems
🔹 Understanding core concepts more deeply
🔹 Improving my technical confidence
🔹 Applying what I learn through real implementation

I consistently experiment, create, and upgrade my work to expand my knowledge in Python, SQL, Software Testing, and other technologies.
My growing project portfolio reflects my dedication to continuous learning, strong problem-solving abilities, and gaining industry-relevant experience.
